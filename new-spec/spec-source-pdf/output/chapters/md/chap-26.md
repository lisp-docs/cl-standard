**26.1 Glossary** 

Each entry in this glossary has the following parts: 

*•* the term being defined, set in boldface. 

*•* optional pronunciation, enclosed in square brackets and set in boldface, as in the following example: [ **a list** ]. The pronunciation key follows *Webster’s Third New International Dictionary the English Language, Unabridged*, except that “* ” is used to notate the schwa (upside-down “e”) character. 

*•* the part or parts of speech, set in italics. If a term can be used as several parts of speech, there is a separate definition for each part of speech. 

*•* one or more definitions, organized as follows: 

– an optional number, present if there are several definitions. Lowercase letters might also be used in cases where subdefinitions of a numbered definition are necessary. 

– an optional part of speech, set in italics, present if the term is one of several parts of speech. 

– an optional discipline, set in italics, present if the term has a standard definition being repeated. For example, “*Math.*” 

– an optional context, present if this definition is meaningful only in that context. For example, “(of a *symbol*)”. 

– the definition. 

– an optional example sentence. For example, “This is an example of an example.” – optional cross references. 

In addition, some terms have idiomatic usage in the Common Lisp community which is not shared by other communities, or which is not technically correct. Definitions labeled “*Idiom.*” represent such idiomatic usage; these definitions are sometimes followed by an explanatory note. 

Words in *this font* are words with entries in the glossary. Words in example sentences do not follow this convention. 

When an ambiguity arises, the longest matching substring has precedence. For example, “*complex float*” refers to a single glossary entry for “*complex float*” rather than the combined meaning of the glossary terms “*complex*” and “*float*.”

(*Implementations* are permitted to provide extensions which distinguish *body parameters* and *rest parameters*—*e.g.*, the *forms* for *operators* which were defined using a *body parameter* might be pretty printed slightly differently than *forms* for *operators* which were defined using *rest parameters*.) 

**boolean** *n.* an *object* of *type* **boolean**; that is, one of the following *objects*: the

**bound** *adj.*, *v.t.* 1. *adj.* having an associated denotation in a *binding*. “The variables named by a **let** are bound within its body.” See *unbound*. 2. *adj.* having a local *binding* which *shadows*<sub>2</sub> another. “The variable **\*print-escape\*** is bound while in the **princ** function.” 3. *v.t.* the past tense of *bind*. 

**bound declaration** *n.* a *declaration* that refers to or is associated with a *variable* or *function* and that appears within the *special form* that *establishes* the *variable* or *function*, but before the body of that *special form* (specifically, at the head of that *form*’s body). (If a *bound declaration* refers to a *function binding* or a *lexical variable binding*, the *scope* of the *declaration* is exactly the *scope* of that *binding*. If the 

*declaration* refers to a *dynamic variable binding*, the *scope* of the *declaration* is what the *scope* of the *binding* would have been if it were lexical rather than dynamic.) 

<b>bounded</b> <i>adj.</i> (of a <i>sequence S</i>, by an ordered pair of <i>bounding indices i<sub>start</sub></i> and <i>i<sub>end</sub></i>) restricted to a subrange of the <i>elements</i> of <i>S</i> that includes each <i>element</i> beginning with (and including) the one indexed by <i>i<sub>start</sub></i> and continuing up to (but not including) the one indexed by <i>i<sub>end</sub></i>.

itself) and **nil** (denoting the *length* of the *sequence*), or two *integers* (each denoting themselves). 

**break loop** *n.* A variant of the normal *Lisp read-eval-print loop* that is recursively entered, usually because the ongoing *evaluation* of some other *form* has been suspended for the purpose of debugging.

**captured initialization form** *n.* an *initialization form* along with the *lexical* 

*environment* in which the *form* that defined the *initialization form* was *evaluated*. “Each newly added shared slot is set to the result of evaluating the captured

(of an *object*) the uniquely determined *class* of which the *object* is a *direct instance*. See the *function* **class-of**. “The class of the object returned by **gensym** is **symbol**.” (Note that with this usage a phrase such as “its *class* is foo” is often substituted for the more precise phrase “its *class* is the *class* named foo”—in both cases, a *class object* (not a *symbol*) is denoted.) 

**class designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *class*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *class* and that is one of: a *symbol* (denoting the *class* named by that *symbol*; see the *function* **find-class**) or a *class* (denoting itself).

**close** *v.t.* (a *stream*) to terminate usage of the *stream* as a source or sink of data, permitting the *implementation* to reclaim its internal data structures, and to free any external resources which might have been locked by the *stream* when it was opened. 

**closed** *adj.* (of a *stream*) having been *closed* (see close). Some (but not all) operations that are valid on *open streams* are not valid on *closed streams*. See Section 21.1.1.1.2 (Open and Closed Streams).

**code** *n.* 1. *Trad.* any representation of actions to be performed, whether conceptual or as an actual *object*, such as *forms*, *lambda expressions*, *objects* of *type function*, text in a *source file*, or instruction sequences in a *compiled file*. This is a generic term; the specific nature of the representation depends on its context. 2. (of a *character* ) a *character code*. 

**coerce** *v.t.* (an *object* to a *type*) to produce an *object* from the given *object*, without modifying that *object*, by following some set of coercion rules that must be specifically stated for any context in which this term is used. The resulting *object* is necessarily of the indicated *type*, except when that type is a *subtype* of *type* **complex**; in that case, if a *complex rational* with an imaginary part of zero would result, the result is a *rational* 

rather than a *complex*—see Section 12.1.5.3 (Rule of Canonical Representation for Complex Rationals). 

**colon** *n.* the *standard character* that is called “colon” (:). See Figure 2–5. 

**comma** *n.* the *standard character* that is called “comma” (,). See Figure 2–5. 

**compilation** *n.* the process of *compiling code* by the *compiler* . 

**compilation environment** *n.* 1. An *environment* that represents information known by the *compiler* about a *form* that is being *compiled*. See Section 3.2.1 (Compiler Terminology). 2. An *object* that represents the *compilation environment* <sub>1</sub> and that is used as a second argument to a *macro function* (which supplies a *value* for any **&environment** *parameter* in the *macro function*’s definition). 

**compilation unit** *n.* an interval during which a single unit of compilation is occurring. See the *macro* **with-compilation-unit**. 

**compile** *v.t.* 1. (*code*) to perform semantic preprocessing of the *code*, usually 

optimizing one or more qualities of the code, such as run-time speed of *execution* or run-time storage usage. The minimum semantic requirements of compilation are that it must remove all macro calls and arrange for all *load time values* to be resolved prior to run time. 2. (a *function*) to produce a new *object* of *type* **compiled-function** which represents the result of *compiling* the *code* represented by the *function*. See the *function* **compile**. 3. (a *source file*) to produce a *compiled file* from a *source file*. See the *function* **compile-file**. 

**compile time** *n.* the duration of time that the *compiler* is processing *source code*. **compile-time definition** *n.* a definition in the *compilation environment*. 

**compiled code** *n.* 1. *compiled functions*. 2. *code* that represents *compiled functions*, such as the contents of a *compiled file*.

**compiled file** *n.* a *file* which represents the results of *compiling* the *forms* which appeared in a corresponding *source file*, and which can be *loaded*. See the *function* **compile-file**. 

**compiled function** *n.* an *object* of *type* **compiled-function**, which is a *function* that has been *compiled*, which contains no references to *macros* that must be expanded at run time, and which contains no unresolved references to *load time values*. 

**compiler** *n.* a facility that is part of Lisp and that translates *code* into an 

*implementation-dependent* form that might be represented or *executed* efficiently. The functions **compile** and **compile-file** permit programs to invoke the *compiler* . 

**compiler macro** *n.* an auxiliary macro definition for a globally defined *function* or *macro* which might or might not be called by any given *conforming implementation* and which must preserve the semantics of the globally defined *function* or *macro* but 

which might perform some additional optimizations. (Unlike a *macro*, a *compiler macro* does not extend the syntax of Common Lisp; rather, it provides an alternate implementation strategy for some existing syntax or functionality.) 

**compiler macro expansion** *n.* 1. the process of translating a *form* into another *form* by a *compiler macro*. 2. the *form* resulting from this process. 

**compiler macro form** *n.* a *function form* or *macro form* whose *operator* has a definition as a *compiler macro*, or a **funcall** *form* whose first *argument* is a **function** *form* whose *argument* is the *name* of a *function* that has a definition as a *compiler macro*. 

**compiler macro function** *n.* a *function* of two arguments, a *form* and an 

*environment*, that implements *compiler macro expansion* by producing either a *form* to be used in place of the original argument *form* or else **nil**, indicating that the original *form* should not be replaced. See Section 3.2.2.1 (Compiler Macros). 

**complex** *n.* an *object* of *type* **complex**. 

**complex float** *n.* an *object* of *type* **complex** which has a *complex part type* that is a *subtype* of **float**. A *complex float* is a *complex* , but it is not a *float*. 

**complex part type** *n.* (of a *complex* ) 1. the *type* which is used to represent both the real part and the imaginary part of the *complex* . 2. the *actual complex part type* of the *complex* . 3. the *expressed complex part type* of the *complex* . 

**complex rational** *n.* an *object* of *type* **complex** which has a *complex part type* that is a *subtype* of **rational**. A *complex rational* is a *complex* , but it is not a *rational*. No *complex rational* has an imaginary part of zero because such a number is always represented by Common Lisp as an *object* of *type* **rational**; see Section 12.1.5.3 (Rule of Canonical Representation for Complex Rationals).

**condition reporter** *n.* a *function* that describes how a *condition* is to be printed when the *Lisp printer* is invoked while **\*print-escape\*** is *false*. See Section 9.1.3 (Printing Conditions). 

**conditional newline** *n.* a point in output where a *newline* might be inserted at the discretion of the *pretty printer* . There are four kinds of *conditional newlines*, called “linear-style,” “fill-style,” “miser-style,” and “mandatory-style.” See the *function* **pprint-newline** and Section 22.2.1.1 (Dynamic Control of the Arrangement of Output).

**constant object** *n.* an *object* that is constrained (*e.g.*, by its context in a *program* or by the source from which it was obtained) to be *immutable*. “A literal object that has been processed by **compile-file** is a constant object.” 

**constant variable** *n.* a *variable*, the *value* of which can never change; that 

is, a *keyword* <sub>1</sub> or a *named constant*. “The symbols **t**, **nil**, :direction, and 

**most-positive-fixnum** are constant variables.”

**contagion** *n.* a process whereby operations on *objects* of differing *types* (*e.g.*, 

arithmetic on mixed *types* of *numbers*) produce a result whose *type* is controlled by the dominance of one *argument*’s *type* over the *types* of the other *arguments*. See Section 12.1.1.2 (Contagion in Numeric Operations). 

**continuable** *n.* (of an *error* ) an *error* that is *correctable* by the continue restart.

(of a <i>list L</i>) a <i>fresh list</i> with the <i>same elements</i> as <i>L</i>. (Only the <i>list structure</i> is <i>fresh</i>; the <i>elements</i> are the <i>same</i>.)

(of a *structure S*) a *fresh structure* that has the same *type* as *S*, and that has slot values, each of which is the *same* as the corresponding slot value of *S*. (Note that since the difference between a *cons*, a *list*, and a *tree* is a matter of “view” or “intention,” there can be no general-purpose *function* which, based solely on the *type* of an *object*, can determine which of these distinct meanings is intended. The distinction rests solely on the basis of the text description within this document. For example, phrases like “a *copy* of the given *list*” or “copy of the *list x*” imply the second definition.) 

**correctable** *adj.* (of an *error* ) 1. (by a *restart* other than **abort** that has been 

associated with the *error* ) capable of being corrected by invoking that *restart*. “The function **cerror** signals an error that is correctable by the **continue** *restart*.” (Note that correctability is not a property of an *error object*, but rather a property of the *dynamic environment* that is in effect when the *error* is *signaled*. Specifically, the *restart* is “associated with” the *error condition object*. See Section 9.1.4.2.4 (Associating a Restart with a Condition).) 2. (when no specific *restart* is mentioned) *correctable*<sub>1</sub> by at least one *restart*. “**import** signals a correctable error of *type* **package-error** if any of the imported symbols has the same name as some distinct symbol already accessible in the package.”

For example, the *debugger* might permit interactive selection of a *restart* from among the *active restarts*, and it might perform additional *implementation-defined* services for the purposes of debugging. 

**declaration** *n.* a *global declaration* or *local declaration*. 

**declaration identifier** *n.* one of the *symbols* **declaration**, **dynamic-extent**, **ftype**, **function**, **ignore**, **inline**, **notinline**, **optimize**, **special**, or **type**; or a *symbol* which is the *name* of a *type*; or a *symbol* which has been *declared* to be a *declaration identifier* by using a **declaration** *declaration*. 

**declaration specifier** *n.* an *expression* that can appear at top level of a **declare** expression or a **declaim** form, or as the argument to **proclaim**, and which has a *car* which is a *declaration identifier* , and which has a *cdr* that is data interpreted according to rules specific to the *declaration identifier* .

**denormalized** *adj.*, *ANSI*, *IEEE* (of a *float*) conforming to the description of 

“denormalized” as described by *IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic*. For example, in an *implementation* where the minimum possible exponent was -7 but where 0.001 was a valid mantissa, the number 1.0e-10 might be representable as 0.001e-7 internally even if the *normalized* representation would call for it to 

be represented instead as 1.0e-10 or 0.1e-9. By their nature, *denormalized floats* generally have less precision than *normalized floats*.

**displaced array** *n.* an *array* which has no storage of its own, but which is instead indirected to the storage of another *array*, called its *target*, at a specified offset, in such a way that any attempt to *access* the *displaced array* implicitly references the *target array*. 

**distinct** *adj.* not *identical*. 

**documentation string** *n.* (in a defining *form*) A *literal string* which because of the context in which it appears (rather than because of some intrinsically observable aspect of the *string*) is taken as documentation.

**element** *n.* 1. (of a *list*) an *object* that is the *car* of one of the *conses* that comprise the *list*. 2. (of an *array*) an *object* that is stored in the *array*. 3. (of a *sequence*) an *object* that is an *element* of the *list* or *array* that is the *sequence*. 4. (of a *type*) an *object* that is a member of the set of *objects* designated by the *type*. 5. (of an *input* 

*stream*) a *character* or *number* (as appropriate to the *element type* of the *stream*) that is among the ordered series of *objects* that can be read from the *stream* (using **read-char** or **read-byte**, as appropriate to the *stream*). 6. (of an *output stream*) a 

*character* or *number* (as appropriate to the *element type* of the *stream*) that is among the ordered series of *objects* that has been or will be written to the *stream* (using **write-char** or **write-byte**, as appropriate to the *stream*). 7. (of a *class*) a *generalized instance* of the *class*. 

**element type** *n.* 1. (of an *array*) the *array element type* of the *array*. 2. (of a *stream*) the *stream element type* of the *stream*. 

**em** *n. Trad.* a context-dependent unit of measure commonly used in typesetting, equal to the displayed width of of a letter “M” in the current font. (The letter “M” is traditionally chosen because it is typically represented by the widest *glyph* in the font, and other characters’ widths are typically fractions of an *em*. In implementations providing non-Roman characters with wider characters than “M,” it is permissible for another character to be the *implementation-defined* reference character for this measure, and for “M” to be only a fraction of an *em* wide.) In a fixed width font, a line with *n* characters is *n ems* wide; in a variable width font, *n ems* is the expected upper bound on the width of such a line. 

**empty list** *n.* the *list* containing no *elements*. See *()*. 

**empty type** *n.* the *type* that contains no *elements*, and that is a *subtype* of all *types* (including itself). See *nil*. 

**end of file** *n.* 1. the point in an *input stream* beyond which there is no further data. Whether or not there is such a point on an *interactive stream* is *implementation defined*. 2. a *situation* that occurs upon an attempt to obtain data from an *input stream* that is at the *end of file*<sub>1</sub>.

**environment** *n.* 1. a set of *bindings*. See Section 3.1.1 (Introduction to Environments). 2. an *environment object*. “**macroexpand** takes an optional environment argument.” 

**environment object** *n.* an *object* representing a set of *lexical bindings*, used in the processing of a *form* to provide meanings for *names* within that *form*. “**macroexpand** takes an optional environment argument.” (The *object* **nil** when used as an *environment object* denotes the *null lexical environment*; the *values* of *environment parameters* to *macro functions* are *objects* of *implementation-dependent* nature which represent the *environment*<sub>1</sub> in which the corresponding *macro form* is to be expanded.) See Section 3.1.1.4 (Environment Objects). 

**environment parameter** *n.* A *parameter* in a *defining form f* for which there is no corresponding *argument*; instead, this *parameter* receives as its value an *environment object* which corresponds to the *lexical environment* in which the *defining form f* appeared. 

**error** *n.* 1. (only in the phrase “is an error”) a *situation* in which the semantics of a program are not specified, and in which the consequences are undefined. 2. a *condition* which represents an *error situation*. See Section 1.4.2 (Error Terminology). 3. an *object* of *type* **error**. 

**error output** *n.* the *output stream* which is the *value* of the *dynamic variable* 

**\*error-output\***. 

**escape** *n.*, *adj.* 1. *n.* a *single escape* or a *multiple escape*. 2. *adj. single escape* or *multiple escape*. 

**establish** *v.t.* to build or bring into being a *binding*, a *declaration*, an *exit point*, a *tag*, a *handler* , a *restart*, or an *environment*. “**let** establishes lexical bindings.” 

**evaluate** *v.t.* (a *form* or an *implicit progn*) to *execute* the *code* represented by the *form* (or the series of *forms* making up the *implicit progn*) by applying the rules of *evaluation*, returning zero or more values. 

**evaluation** *n.* a model whereby *forms* are *executed*, returning zero or more values. Such execution might be implemented directly in one step by an interpreter or in two steps by first *compiling* the *form* and then *executing* the *compiled code*; this choice is dependent both on context and the nature of the *implementation*, but in any case is not in general detectable by any program. The evaluation model is designed in such a way that a *conforming implementation* might legitimately have only a compiler and no interpreter, or vice versa. See Section 3.1.2 (The Evaluation Model). 

**evaluation environment** *n.* a *run-time environment* in which macro expanders and code specified by **eval-when** to be evaluated are evaluated. All evaluations initiated by the *compiler* take place in the *evaluation environment*.

**execute** *v.t. Trad.* (*code*) to perform the imperative actions represented by the *code*. **execution time** *n.* the duration of time that *compiled code* is being *executed*. 

**exhaustive partition** *n.* (of a *type*) a set of *pairwise disjoint types* that form an *exhaustive union*. 

**exhaustive union** *n.* (of a *type*) a set of *subtypes* of the *type*, whose union contains all *elements* of that *type*. 

**exit point** *n.* a point in a *control form* from which (*e.g.*, **block**), through which (*e.g.*, **unwind-protect**), or to which (*e.g.*, **tagbody**) control and possibly *values* can be transferred both actively by using another *control form* and passively through the normal control and data flow of *evaluation*. “**catch** and **block** establish bindings for exit points to which **throw** and **return-from**, respectively, can transfer control and values; **tagbody** establishes a binding for an exit point with lexical extent to which **go** can transfer control; and **unwind-protect** establishes an exit point through which control might be transferred by operators such as **throw**, **return-from**, and **go**.” 

**explicit return** *n.* the act of transferring control (and possibly *values*) to a *block* by using **return-from** (or **return**). 

**explicit use** *n.* (of a *variable V* in a *form F*) a reference to *V* that is directly apparent in the normal semantics of *F*; *i.e.*, that does not expose any undocumented details of the *macro expansion* of the *form* itself. References to *V* exposed by expanding *subforms* of *F* are, however, considered to be *explicit uses* of *V* . 

**exponent marker** *n.* a character that is used in the textual notation for a *float* to separate the mantissa from the exponent. The characters defined as *exponent markers* in the *standard readtable* are shown in Figure 26–1.

**exported** *adj.* (of a *symbol* in a *package*) being an *external symbol* of the *package*. 

**expressed adjustability** *n.* (of an *array*) a *generalized boolean* that is conceptually (but not necessarily actually) associated with the *array*, representing whether the *array* is *expressly adjustable*. See also *actual adjustability*. 

**expressed array element type** *n.* (of an *array*) the *type* which is the *array element type* implied by a *type declaration* for the *array*, or which is the requested *array* 

*element type* at its time of creation, prior to any selection of an *upgraded array element type*. (Common Lisp does not provide a way of detecting this *type* directly at run time, but an *implementation* is permitted to make assumptions about the *array*’s contents and the operations which may be performed on the *array* when this *type* is noted during code analysis, even if those assumptions would not be valid in general for the *upgraded array element type* of the *expressed array element type*.) 

**expressed complex part type** *n.* (of a *complex* ) the *type* which is implied as the *complex part type* by a *type declaration* for the *complex* , or which is the requested *complex part type* at its time of creation, prior to any selection of an *upgraded complex part type*. (Common Lisp does not provide a way of detecting this *type* directly at run time, but an *implementation* is permitted to make assumptions about the operations which may be performed on the *complex* when this *type* is noted during code analysis, even if those assumptions would not be valid in general for the *upgraded complex part type* of the *expressed complex part type*.) 

**expression** *n.* 1. an *object*, often used to emphasize the use of the *object* to encode or represent information in a specialized format, such as program text. “The second expression in a **let** form is a list of bindings.” 2. the textual notation used to notate an *object* in a source file. “The expression ’sample is equivalent to (quote sample).” 

**expressly adjustable** *adj.* (of an *array*) being *actually adjustable* by virtue of an explicit request for this characteristic having been made at the time of its creation. All *arrays* that are *expressly adjustable* are *actually adjustable*, but not necessarily vice versa. 

**extended character** *n.* a *character* of *type* **extended-char**: a *character* that is not a *base character* . 

**extended function designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *function*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *function* and that is one of: a *function name* (denoting the *function* it names in the *global environment*), or a *function* (denoting itself). The consequences are undefined if a *function name* is used as an *extended function designator* but it does not have a global definition as a *function*, or if it is a *symbol* that has a global definition as a *macro* or a *special form*. See also *function designator* .

**extension** *n.* a facility in an *implementation* of Common Lisp that is not specified by this standard. 

**extent** *n.* the interval of time during which a *reference* to an *object*, a *binding*, an *exit point*, a *tag*, a *handler* , a *restart*, or an *environment* is defined. 

**external file format** *n.* an *object* of *implementation-dependent* nature which 

determines one of possibly several *implementation-dependent* ways in which *characters* are encoded externally in a *character file*. 

**external file format designator** *n.* a *designator* for an *external file format*; that is, an *object* that denotes an *external file format* and that is one of: the *symbol* 

:default (denoting an *implementation-dependent* default *external file format* that can accomodate at least the *base characters*), some other *object* defined by the 

*implementation* to be an *external file format designator* (denoting an *implementation defined external file format*), or some other *object* defined by the *implementation* to be an *external file format* (denoting itself). 

**external symbol** *n.* (of a *package*) a *symbol* that is part of the ‘external interface’ to the *package* and that are *inherited* <sub>3</sub> by any other *package* that *uses* the *package*. When using the *Lisp reader* , if a *package prefix* is used, the *name* of an *external symbol* is separated from the *package name* by a single *package marker* while the *name* of an *internal symbol* is separated from the *package name* by a double *package marker* ; see Section 2.3.4 (Symbols as Tokens). 

**externalizable object** *n.* an *object* that can be used as a *literal object* in *code* to be processed by the *file compiler* . 

**F** 

**false** *n.* the *symbol* **nil**, used to represent the failure of a *predicate* test. 

**fbound** [ **ef ba\_und** ] *adj.* (of a *function name*) *bound* in the *function namespace*. (The *names* of *macros* and *special operators* are *fbound*, but the nature and *type* of the *object* which is their *value* is *implementation-dependent*. Further, defining a *setf expander F* does not cause the *setf function* (setf *F*) to become defined; as such, if 

there is a such a definition of a *setf expander F*, the *function* (setf *F*) can be *fbound* if and only if, by design or coincidence, a function binding for (setf *F*) has been independently established.) See the *functions* **fboundp** and **symbol-function**. 

**feature** *n.* 1. an aspect or attribute of Common Lisp, of the *implementation*, or of the *environment*. 2. a *symbol* that names a *feature*<sub>1</sub>. See Section 24.1.2 (Features). “The :ansi-cl feature is present in all conforming implementations.”

**feature expression** *n.* A boolean combination of *features* used by the #+ and #- *reader macros* in order to direct conditional *reading* of *expressions* by the *Lisp reader* . See Section 24.1.2.1 (Feature Expressions). 

**features list** *n.* the *list* that is the *value* of **\*features\***. 

**file** *n.* a named entry in a *file system*, having an *implementation-defined* nature. 

**file compiler** *n.* any *compiler* which *compiles source code* contained in a *file*, producing a *compiled file* as output. The **compile-file** function is the only interface to such a *compiler* provided by Common Lisp, but there might be other, *implementation-defined* mechanisms for invoking the *file compiler* . 

**file position** *n.* (in a *stream*) a non-negative *integer* that represents a position in the *stream*. Not all *streams* are able to represent the notion of *file position*; in the description of any *operator* which manipulates *file positions*, the behavior for *streams* that don’t have this notion must be explicitly stated. For *binary streams*, the *file position* represents the number of preceding *bytes* in the *stream*. For *character streams*, the constraint is more relaxed: *file positions* must increase monotonically, the amount of the increase between *file positions* corresponding to any two successive characters in the *stream* is *implementation-dependent*. 

**file position designator** *n.* (in a *stream*) a *designator* for a *file position* in that *stream*; that is, the symbol :start (denoting 0, the first *file position* in that *stream*), the symbol :end (denoting the last *file position* in that *stream*; *i.e.*, the position 

following the last *element* of the *stream*), or a *file position* (denoting itself). 

**file stream** *n.* an *object* of *type* **file-stream**. 

**file system** *n.* a facility which permits aggregations of data to be stored in named *files* on some medium that is external to the *Lisp image* and that therefore persists from *session* to *session*. 

**filename** *n.* a handle, not necessarily ever directly represented as an *object*, that can be used to refer to a *file* in a *file system*. *Pathnames* and *namestrings* are two kinds of *objects* that substitute for *filenames* in Common Lisp. 

**fill pointer** *n.* (of a *vector* ) an *integer* associated with a *vector* that represents the index above which no *elements* are *active*. (A *fill pointer* is a non-negative *integer* no larger than the total number of *elements* in the *vector* . Not all *vectors* have *fill pointers*.) 

**finite** *adj.* (of a *type*) having a finite number of *elements*. “The type specifier 

(integer 0 5) denotes a finite type, but the type specifiers **integer** and (integer 0) do not.”

**format control** *n.* a *format string*, or a *function* that obeys the *argument* conventions for a *function* returned by the **formatter** *macro*. See Section 22.2.1.3 (Compiling Format Strings). 

**format directive** *n.* 1. a sequence of *characters* in a *format string* which is introduced by a *tilde*, and which is specially interpreted by *code* which processes *format strings* to mean that some special operation should be performed, possibly involving data supplied by the *format arguments* that accompanied the *format string*. See the 

*function* **format**. “In "~D base 10 = ~8R", the character sequences ‘~D’ and ‘~8R’ are format directives.” 2. the conceptual category of all *format directives*<sub>1</sub> which use the same dispatch character. “Both "~3d" and "~3,’0D" are valid uses of the ‘~D’ format directive.” 

**format string** *n.* a *string* which can contain both ordinary text and *format directives*, and which is used in conjunction with *format arguments* to describe how text output should be formatted by certain functions, such as **format**. 

**free declaration** *n.* a declaration that is not a *bound declaration*. See **declare**. 

**fresh** *adj.* 1. (of an *object yielded* by a *function*) having been newly-allocated by that *function*. (The caller of a *function* that returns a *fresh object* may freely modify the *object* without fear that such modification will compromise the future correct behavior of that *function*.) 2. (of a *binding* for a *name*) newly-allocated; not shared with other *bindings* for that *name*.

**freshline** *n.* a conceptual operation on a *stream*, implemented by the *function* 

**fresh-line** and by the *format directive* ~&, which advances the display position to the beginning of the next line (as if a *newline* had been typed, or the *function* **terpri** had been called) unless the *stream* is already known to be positioned at the beginning of a line. Unlike *newline*, *freshline* is not a *character* . 

**funbound** [ **efunba\_und** ] *n.* (of a *function name*) not *fbound*. 

**function** *n.* 1. an *object* representing code, which can be *called* with zero or more *arguments*, and which produces zero or more *values*. 2. an *object* of *type* **function**. 

**function block name** *n.* (of a *function name*) The *symbol* that would be used as the name of an *implicit block* which surrounds the body of a *function* having that *function name*. If the *function name* is a *symbol*, its *function block name* is the *function name* itself. If the *function name* is a *list* whose *car* is **setf** and whose *cadr* is a *symbol*, 

its *function block name* is the *symbol* that is the *cadr* of the *function name*. An *implementation* which supports additional kinds of *function names* must specify for each how the corresponding *function block name* is computed. 

**function cell** *n. Trad.* (of a *symbol*) The *place* which holds the *definition* of the global *function binding*, if any, named by that *symbol*, and which is *accessed* by **symbol-function**. See *cell*. 

**function designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *function*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *function* and that is one of: a *symbol* (denoting the *function* named by that *symbol* in the *global environment*), or a *function* (denoting itself). The consequences are undefined if a *symbol* is used as a *function designator* but it does not have a global definition as a *function*, or it has a global definition as a *macro* or a *special form*. See also *extended function designator* . 

**function form** *n.* a *form* that is a *list* and that has a first element which is the *name* of a *function* to be called on *arguments* which are the result of *evaluating* subsequent elements of the *function form*. 

**function name** *n.* 1. (in an *environment*) A *symbol* or a *list* (setf *symbol*) that is the *name* of a *function* in that *environment*. 2. A *symbol* or a *list* (setf *symbol*). 

**functional evaluation** *n.* the process of extracting a *functional value* from a *function name* or a *lambda expression*. The evaluator performs *functional evaluation* implicitly when it encounters a *function name* or a *lambda expression* in the *car* of a *compound form*, or explicitly when it encounters a **function** *special form*. Neither a use of a 

*symbol* as a *function designator* nor a use of the *function* **symbol-function** to extract the *functional value* of a *symbol* is considered a *functional evaluation*. 

**functional value** *n.* 1. (of a *function name N* in an *environment E*) The *value* of the *binding* named *N* in the *function namespace* for *environment E*; that is, the

(of an *fbound symbol S*) the contents of the *symbol*’s *function cell*; that is, the *value* of the *binding* named *S* in the *function namespace* of the *global environment*. (A *name* that is a *macro name* in the *global environment* or is a *special operator* might or might not be *fbound*. But if *S* is such a *name* and is *fbound*, the specific nature of its *functional value* is *implementation-dependent*; in particular, it might or might not be a *function*.) 

**further compilation** *n. implementation-dependent* compilation beyond *minimal compilation*. Further compilation is permitted to take place at *run time*. “Block compilation and generation of machine-specific instructions are examples of further compilation.” 

**G** 

**general** *adj.* (of an *array*) having *element type* **t**, and consequently able to have any *object* as an *element*. 

**generalized boolean** *n.* an *object* used as a truth value, where the symbol **nil** 

represents *false* and all other *objects* represent *true*. See *boolean*. 

**generalized instance** *n.* (of a *class*) an *object* the *class* of which is either that *class* itself, or some subclass of that *class*. (Because of the correspondence between types and classes, the term “generalized instance of *X*” implies “object of type *X*” and in cases where *X* is a *class* (or *class name*) the reverse is also true. The former terminology emphasizes the view of *X* as a *class* while the latter emphasizes the view of *X* as a *type specifier* .) 

**generalized reference** *n.* a reference to a location storing an *object* as if to a 

*variable*. (Such a reference can be either to *read* or *write* the location.) See Section 5.1 (Generalized Reference). See also *place*. 

**generalized synonym stream** *n.* (with a *synonym stream symbol*) 1. (to a *stream*) a *synonym stream* to the *stream*, or a *composite stream* which has as a target a 

*generalized synonym stream* to the *stream*. 2. (to a *symbol*) a *synonym stream* to the *symbol*, or a *composite stream* which has as a target a *generalized synonym stream* to the *symbol*. 

**generic function** *n.* a *function* whose behavior depends on the *classes* or identities of the arguments supplied to it and whose parts include, among other things, a set of *methods*, a *lambda list*, and a *method combination* type. 

**generic function lambda list** *n.* A *lambda list* that is used to describe data flow into a *generic function*. See Section 3.4.2 (Generic Function Lambda Lists).

**immutable** *adj.* not subject to change, either because no *operator* is provided which is capable of effecting such change or because some constraint exists which prohibits the use of an *operator* that might otherwise be capable of effecting such a change. Except as explicitly indicated otherwise, *implementations* are not required to detect attempts to modify *immutable objects* or *cells*; the consequences of attempting to make such 

modification are undefined. “Numbers are immutable.”

Lisp which has been deliberately left unspecified, that might be defined in some 

*conforming implementations* but not in others, and whose details may differ between *implementations*. A *conforming implementation* is encouraged (but not required) to document its treatment of each item in this specification which is marked 

*implementation-dependent*, although in some cases such documentation might simply identify the item as “undefined.” 

**implementation-independent** *adj.* used to identify or emphasize a behavior or aspect of Common Lisp which does not vary between *conforming implementations*. 

**implicit block** *n.* a *block* introduced by a *macro form* rather than by an explicit **block** *form*.

**internal symbol** *n.* (of a *package*) a symbol which is *accessible* in the *package*, but which is not an *external symbol* of the *package*. 

**internal time** *n. time*, represented as an *integer* number of *internal time units*. *Absolute internal time* is measured as an offset from an arbitrarily chosen, 

*implementation-dependent* base. See Section 25.1.4.3 (Internal Time). 

**internal time unit** *n.* a unit of time equal to 1*/n* of a second, for some *implementation defined integer* value of *n*. See the *variable* **internal-time-units-per-second**. 

**interned** *adj. Trad.* 1. (of a *symbol*) *accessible*<sub>3</sub> in any *package*. 2. (of a *symbol* in a specific *package*) *present* in that *package*. 

**interpreted function** *n.* a *function* that is not a *compiled function*. (It is possible for there to be a *conforming implementation* which has no *interpreted functions*, but a *conforming program* must not assume that all *functions* are *compiled functions*.) 

**interpreted implementation** *n.* an *implementation* that uses an execution strategy for *interpreted functions* that does not involve a one-time semantic analysis pre-pass, and instead uses “lazy” (and sometimes repetitious) semantic analysis of *forms* as they are encountered during execution.

**K** 

**key** *n.* an *object* used for selection during retrieval. See *association list*, *property list*, and *hash table*. Also, see Section 17.1 (Sequence Concepts). 

**keyword** *n.* 1. a *symbol* the *home package* of which is the KEYWORD *package*. 2. 

any *symbol*, usually but not necessarily in the KEYWORD *package*, that is used as an identifying marker in keyword-style argument passing. See **lambda**. 3. *Idiom.* a *lambda list keyword*. 

**keyword parameter** *n.* A *parameter* for which a corresponding keyword *argument* is optional. (There is no such thing as a required keyword *argument*.) If the *argument* is not supplied, a default value is used. See also *supplied-p parameter* . 

**keyword/value pair** *n.* two successive *elements* (a *keyword* and a *value*, respectively) of a *property list*.

**lambda combination** *n. Trad.* a *lambda form*. 

**lambda expression** *n.* a *list* which can be used in place of a *function name* in certain contexts to denote a *function* by directly describing its behavior rather than indirectly by referring to the name of an *established function*; its name derives from the fact that its first element is the *symbol* lambda. See **lambda**. 

**lambda form** *n.* a *form* that is a *list* and that has a first element which is a *lambda expression* representing a *function* to be called on *arguments* which are the result of *evaluating* subsequent elements of the *lambda form*.

**lambda list keyword** *n.* a *symbol* whose *name* begins with *ampersand* and that is specially recognized in a *lambda list*. Note that no *standardized lambda list keyword* is in the KEYWORD *package*. 

**lambda variable** *n.* a *formal parameter* , used to emphasize the *variable*’s relation to the *lambda list* that *established* it. 

**leaf** *n.* 1. an *atom* in a *tree*<sub>1</sub>. 2. a terminal node of a *tree*<sub>2</sub>. 

**leap seconds** *n.* additional one-second intervals of time that are occasionally inserted into the true calendar by official timekeepers as a correction similar to “leap years.” All Common Lisp *time* representations ignore *leap seconds*; every day is assumed to be exactly 86400 seconds long. 

**left-parenthesis** *n.* the *standard character* “(”, that is variously called “left 

parenthesis” or “open parenthesis” See Figure 2–5. 

**length** *n.* (of a *sequence*) the number of *elements* in the *sequence*. (Note that if the *sequence* is a *vector* with a *fill pointer* , its *length* is the same as the *fill pointer* even though the total allocated size of the *vector* might be larger.) 

**lexical binding** *n.* a *binding* in a *lexical environment*. 

**lexical closure** *n.* a *function* that, when invoked on *arguments*, executes the body of a *lambda expression* in the *lexical environment* that was captured at the time of the creation of the *lexical closure*, augmented by *bindings* of the *function*’s *parameters* to the corresponding *arguments*. 

**lexical environment** *n.* that part of the *environment* that contains *bindings* whose names have *lexical scope*. A *lexical environment* contains, among other things: 

ordinary *bindings* of *variable names* to *values*, lexically *established bindings* of *function names* to *functions*, *macros*, *symbol macros*, *blocks*, *tags*, and *local declarations* (see **declare**). 

**lexical scope** *n. scope* that is limited to a spatial or textual region within the 

establishing *form*. “The names of parameters to a function normally are lexically scoped.” 

**lexical variable** *n.* a *variable* the *binding* for which is in the *lexical environment*. 

**Lisp image** *n.* a running instantiation of a Common Lisp *implementation*. A *Lisp image* is characterized by a single address space in which any *object* can directly refer to any another in conformance with this specification, and by a single, common, *global environment*. (External operating systems sometimes call this a “core image,” “fork,” “incarnation,” “job,” or “process.” Note however, that the issue of a “process” in such

an operating system is technically orthogonal to the issue of a *Lisp image* being defined here. Depending on the operating system, a single “process” might have multiple *Lisp images*, and multiple “processes” might reside in a single *Lisp image*. Hence, it is the idea of a fully shared address space for direct reference among all *objects* which is the defining characteristic. Note, too, that two “processes” which have a communication 

area that permits the sharing of some but not all *objects* are considered to be distinct *Lisp images*.) 

**Lisp printer** *n. Trad.* the procedure that prints the character representation of an *object* onto a *stream*. (This procedure is implemented by the *function* **write**.) 

**Lisp read-eval-print loop** *n. Trad.* an endless loop that *reads*<sub>2</sub> a *form*, *evaluates* it, and prints (*i.e.*, *writes*<sub>2</sub>) the results. In many *implementations*, the default mode of interaction with Common Lisp during program development is through such a loop. 

**Lisp reader** *n. Trad.* the procedure that parses character representations of *objects* from a *stream*, producing *objects*. (This procedure is implemented by the *function* **read**.) 

**list** *n.* 1. a chain of *conses* in which the *car* of each *cons* is an *element* of the *list*, and the *cdr* of each *cons* is either the next link in the chain or a terminating *atom*. See also *proper list*, *dotted list*, or *circular list*. 2. the *type* that is the union of **null** and **cons**. 

**list designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *list* of *objects*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *list* and that is one of: a *non-nil atom* (denoting a *singleton list* whose *element* is that *non-nil atom*) or a *proper list* (denoting itself). 

<b>list structure</b> <i>n.</i> (of a <i>list</i>) the set of <i>conses</i> that make up the <i>list</i>. Note that while the <i>car</i> <sub>1<i>b</i></sub> component of each such <i>cons</i> is part of the <i>list structure</i>, the <i>objects</i> that are <i>elements</i> of the <i>list</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>objects</i> that are the <i>cars</i><sub>2</sub> of each <i>cons</i> in the <i>list</i>) are not themselves part of its <i>list structure</i>, even if they are <i>conses</i>, except in the (<i>circular</i> <sub>2</sub>) case where the <i>list</i> actually contains one of its <i>tails</i> as an <i>element</i>. (The <i>list structure</i> of a <i>list</i> is sometimes redundantly referred to as its “top-level list structure” in order to emphasize that any <i>conses</i> that are <i>elements</i> of the <i>list</i> are not involved.) 

**literal** *adj.* (of an *object*) referenced directly in a program rather than being computed by the program; that is, appearing as data in a **quote** *form*, or, if the *object* is a *self evaluating object*, appearing as unquoted data. “In the form (cons "one" ’("two")), the expressions "one", ("two"), and "two" are literal objects.” 

**load** *v.t.* (a *file*) to cause the *code* contained in the *file* to be *executed*. See the *function* **load**. 

**load time** *n.* the duration of time that the loader is *loading compiled code*.

**load time value** *n.* an *object* referred to in *code* by a **load-time-value** *form*. The *value* of such a *form* is some specific *object* which can only be computed in the 

run-time *environment*. In the case of *file compilation*, the *value* is computed once as part of the process of *loading* the *compiled file*, and not again. See the *special operator* **load-time-value**. 

**loader** *n.* a facility that is part of Lisp and that *loads* a *file*. See the *function* **load**.

**logical block** *n.* a conceptual grouping of related output used by the *pretty printer* . See the *macro* **pprint-logical-block** and Section 22.2.1.1 (Dynamic Control of the Arrangement of Output). 

**logical host** *n.* an *object* of *implementation-dependent* nature that is used as the representation of a “host” in a *logical pathname*, and that has an associated set of translation rules for converting *logical pathnames* belonging to that host into *physical pathnames*. See Section 19.3 (Logical Pathnames). 

**logical host designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *logical host*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *logical host* and that is one of: a *string* (denoting the *logical host* that it names), or a *logical host* (denoting itself). (Note that because the representation of a *logical host* is *implementation-dependent*, it is possible that an *implementation* might represent a *logical host* as the *string* that names it.) 

**logical pathname** *n.* an *object* of *type* **logical-pathname**. 

**long float** *n.* an *object* of *type* **long-float**. 

**loop keyword** *n. Trad.* a symbol that is a specially recognized part of the syntax of an extended **loop** *form*. Such symbols are recognized by their *name* (using **string=**), not by their identity; as such, they may be in any package. A *loop keyword* is not a *keyword*. 

**lowercase** *adj.* (of a *character* ) being among *standard characters* corresponding to the small letters a through z, or being some other *implementation-defined character* that

**M** 

**macro** *n.* 1. a *macro form* 2. a *macro function*. 3. a *macro name*. 

**macro character** *n.* a *character* which, when encountered by the *Lisp reader* in its main dispatch loop, introduces a *reader macro*<sub>1</sub>. (*Macro characters* have nothing to do with *macros*.) 

**macro expansion** *n.* 1. the process of translating a *macro form* into another *form*. 2. the *form* resulting from this process. 

**macro form** *n.* a *form* that stands for another *form* (*e.g.*, for the purposes of 

abstraction, information hiding, or syntactic convenience); that is, either a *compound form* whose first element is a *macro name*, or a *form* that is a *symbol* that names a *symbol macro*. 

**macro function** *n.* a *function* of two arguments, a *form* and an *environment*, that implements *macro expansion* by producing a *form* to be evaluated in place of the original argument *form*. 

**macro lambda list** *n.* an *extended lambda list* used in *forms* that *establish macro* definitions, such as **defmacro** and **macrolet**. See Section 3.4.4 (Macro Lambda Lists). 

**macro name** *n.* a *name* for which **macro-function** returns *true* and which when used as the first element of a *compound form* identifies that *form* as a *macro form*. 

**macroexpand hook** *n.* the *function* that is the *value* of **\*macroexpand-hook\***. 

**mapping** *n.* 1. a type of iteration in which a *function* is successively applied to *objects* taken from corresponding entries in collections such as *sequences* or *hash tables*. 2. *Math.* a relation between two sets in which each element of the first set (the “domain”) is assigned one element of the second set (the “range”). 

**metaclass** *n.* 1. a *class* whose instances are *classes*. 2. (of an *object*) the *class* of the *class* of the *object*. 

**Metaobject Protocol** *n.* one of many possible descriptions of how a *conforming implementation* might implement various aspects of the object system. This description is beyond the scope of this document, and no *conforming implementation* is required to adhere to it except as noted explicitly in this specification. Nevertheless, its existence helps to establish normative practice, and implementors with no reason to diverge from it are encouraged to consider making their *implementation* adhere to it where possible. It is described in detail in *The Art of the Metaobject Protocol*.

**multiple escape** *n.*, *adj.* 1. *n.* the *syntax type* of a *character* that is used in pairs to indicate that the enclosed *characters* are to be treated as *alphabetic*<sub>2</sub> *characters* with their *case* preserved. For details, see Section 2.1.4.5 (Multiple Escape Characters). 2. *adj.* (of a *character* ) having the *multiple escape syntax type*. 3. *n.* a *multiple escape*<sub>2</sub> *character* .

**named constant** *n.* a *variable* that is defined by Common Lisp, by the *implementation*, or by user code (see the *macro* **defconstant**) to always *yield* the same *value* when *evaluated*. “The value of a named constant may not be changed by assignment or by binding.” 

**namespace** *n.* 1. *bindings* whose denotations are restricted to a particular kind. “The bindings of names to tags is the tag namespace.” 2. any *mapping* whose domain is a set of *names*. “A package defines a namespace.”

**non-nil** *n.*, *adj.* not **nil**. Technically, any *object* which is not **nil** can be referred to as *true*, but that would tend to imply a unique view of the *object* as a *generalized boolean*. Referring to such an *object* as *non-nil* avoids this implication. 

**non-null lexical environment** *n.* a *lexical environment* that has additional 

information not present in the *global environment*, such as one or more *bindings*. 

**non-simple** *adj.* not *simple*. 

**non-terminating** *adj.* (of a *macro character* ) being such that it is treated as a 

constituent *character* when it appears in the middle of an extended token. See Section 2.2 (Reader Algorithm). 

**non-top-level form** *n.* a *form* that, by virtue of its position as a *subform* of another *form*, is not a *top level form*. See Section 3.2.3.1 (Processing of Top Level Forms). 

**normal return** *n.* the natural transfer of control and *values* which occurs after the complete *execution* of a *form*. 

**normalized** *adj.*, *ANSI*, *IEEE* (of a *float*) conforming to the description of 

“normalized” as described by *IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic*. See *denormalized*. 

**null** *adj.*, *n.* 1. *adj.* a. (of a *list*) having no *elements*: empty. See *empty list*. b. (of a *string*) having a *length* of zero. (It is common, both within this document and in observed spoken behavior, to refer to an empty string by an apparent definite reference, as in “the *null string*” even though no attempt is made to *intern*<sub>2</sub> null strings. The phrase “a *null string*” is technically more correct, but is generally considered awkward by most Lisp programmers. As such, the phrase “the *null string*” should be treated as an indefinite reference in all cases except for anaphoric references.) c. (of an *implementation-defined attribute* of a *character* ) An *object* to which the value of that *attribute* defaults if no specific value was requested. 2. *n.* an *object* of *type* **null** (the only such *object* being **nil**). 

**null lexical environment** *n.* the *lexical environment* which has no *bindings*.

**object** *n.* 1. any Lisp datum. “The function **cons** creates an object which refers to two other objects.” 2. (immediately following the name of a *type*) an *object* which is of that *type*, used to emphasize that the *object* is not just a *name* for an object of that *type* but really an *element* of the *type* in cases where *objects* of that *type* (such as **function** or **class**) are commonly referred to by *name*. “The function **symbol-function** takes a function name and returns a function object.” 

**object-traversing** *adj.* operating in succession on components of an *object*. 

“The operators **mapcar**, **maphash**, **with-package-iterator** and **count** perform 

object-traversing operations.” 

**open** *adj.*, *v.t.* (a *file*) 1. *v.t.* to create and return a *stream* to the *file*. 2. *adj.* (of a *stream*) having been *opened* <sub>1</sub>, but not yet *closed*.

(of a *compound form*) the *car* of the *compound form*, which might be either an *operator* <sub>2</sub> or a *lambda expression*, and which is never (setf *symbol*). 

**optimize quality** *n.* one of several aspects of a program that might be optimizable by certain compilers. Since optimizing one such quality might conflict with optimizing another, relative priorities for qualities can be established in an **optimize** *declaration*. The *standardized optimize qualities* are compilation-speed (speed of the compilation process), debug (ease of debugging), safety (run-time error checking), space (both code size and run-time space), and speed (of the object code). *Implementations* may define additional *optimize qualities*. 

**optional parameter** *n.* A *parameter* for which a corresponding positional *argument* is optional. If the *argument* is not supplied, a default value is used. See also *supplied-p parameter* . 

**ordinary function** *n.* a *function* that is not a *generic function*. 

**ordinary lambda list** *n.* the kind of *lambda list* used by **lambda**. See *modified lambda list* and *extended lambda list*. “**defun** uses an ordinary lambda list.”

**package** *n.* an *object* of *type* **package**. 

**package cell** *n. Trad.* (of a *symbol*) The *place* in a *symbol* that holds one of possibly several *packages* in which the *symbol* is *interned*, called the *home package*, or which holds **nil** if no such *package* exists or is known. See the *function* **symbol-package**. 

**package designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *package*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *package* and that is one of: a *string designator* (denoting the *package* that has the *string* that it designates as its *name* or as one of its *nicknames*), or a *package* (denoting itself). 

**package marker** *n.* a character which is used in the textual notation for a symbol to separate the package name from the symbol name, and which is *colon* in the *standard readtable*. See Section 2.1 (Character Syntax). 

**package prefix** *n.* a notation preceding the *name* of a *symbol* in text that is processed by the *Lisp reader* , which uses a *package name* followed by one or more *package markers*, and which indicates that the symbol is looked up in the indicated *package*. 

**package registry** *n.* A mapping of *names* to *package objects*. It is possible for there to be a *package object* which is not in this mapping; such a *package* is called an *unregistered package*. *Operators* such as **find-package** consult this mapping in order to find a *package* from its *name*. *Operators* such as **do-all-symbols**, **find-all-symbols**, and **list-all-packages** operate only on *packages* that exist in the *package registry*. 

**pairwise** *adv.* (of an adjective on a set) applying individually to all possible pairings of elements of the set. “The types *A*, *B*, and *C* are pairwise disjoint if *A* and *B* are disjoint, *B* and *C* are disjoint, and *A* and *C* are disjoint.” 

**parallel** *adj. Trad.* (of *binding* or *assignment*) done in the style of **psetq**, **let**, or **do**; that is, first evaluating all of the *forms* that produce *values*, and only then *assigning* or *binding* the *variables* (or *places*). Note that this does not imply traditional 

computational “parallelism” since the *forms* that produce *values* are evaluated 

*sequentially*. See *sequential*.

(of a *function*) a *variable* in the definition of a *function* which takes on the *value* of a corresponding *argument* (or of a *list* of corresponding arguments) to that *function* when it is called, or which in some cases is given a default value because there is no corresponding *argument*. 2. (of a *format directive*) an *object* received as 

data flow by a *format directive* due to a prefix notation within the *format string* at the *format directive*’s point of use. See Section 22.3 (Formatted Output). “In "~3,’0D", the number 3 and the character #\0 are parameters to the ~D format directive.”

**pretty print** *v.t.* (an *object*) to invoke the *pretty printer* on the *object*. 

**pretty printer** *n.* the procedure that prints the character representation of an 

*object* onto a *stream* when the *value* of **\*print-pretty\*** is *true*, and that uses layout techniques (*e.g.*, indentation) that tend to highlight the structure of the *object* in a way that makes it easier for human readers to parse visually. See the *variable* **\*print-pprint-dispatch\*** and Section 22.2 (The Lisp Pretty Printer). 

**pretty printing stream** *n.* a *stream* that does pretty printing. Such streams are created by the *function* **pprint-logical-block** as a link between the output stream and the logical block. 

**primary method** *n.* a member of one of two sets of *methods* (the set of *auxiliary methods* is the other) that form an exhaustive partition of the set of *methods* on the *method*’s *generic function*. How these sets are determined is dependent on the *method combination* type; see Section 7.6.2 (Introduction to Methods).

**property list** *n.* 1. a *list* containing an even number of *elements* that are alternating *names* (sometimes called *indicators* or *keys*) and *values* (sometimes called *properties*). When there is more than one *name* and *value* pair with the *identical name* in

**property value** *n.* (of a *property indicator* on a *property list*) the *object* associated with the *property indicator* on the *property list*. 

**purports to conform** *v.* makes a good-faith claim of conformance. This term 

expresses intention to conform, regardless of whether the goal of that intention is realized in practice. For example, language implementations have been known to have bugs, and while an *implementation* of this specification with bugs might not be a *conforming implementation*, it can still *purport to conform*.

35, respectively. Case is not significant in parsing numbers of radix greater than 10, so “9b8a” and “9B8A” denote the same *radix* 16 number.)

**stack allocate** *v.t. Trad.* to allocate in a non-permanent way, such as on a stack. Stack-allocation is an optimization technique used in some *implementations* for 

allocating certain kinds of *objects* that have *dynamic extent*. Such *objects* are allocated on the stack rather than in the heap so that their storage can be freed as part of unwinding the stack rather than taking up space in the heap until the next garbage collection.

**type declaration** *n.* a *declaration* that asserts that every reference to a specified *binding* within the scope of the *declaration* results in some *object* of the specified *type*. 

**type equivalent** *adj.* (of two *types X* and *Y* ) having the same *elements*; that is, *X* is a *subtype* of *Y* and *Y* is a *subtype* of *X*. 

**type expand** *n.* to fully expand a *type specifier* , removing any references to *derived types*. (Common Lisp provides no program interface to cause this to occur, but the semantics of Common Lisp are such that every *implementation* must be able to do 

this internally, and some situations involving *type specifiers* are most easily described in terms of a fully expanded *type specifier* .) 

**type specifier** *n.* an *expression* that denotes a *type*. “The symbol random-state, the list (integer 3 5), the list (and list (not null)), and the class named standard-class are type specifiers.” 

**U** 

**unbound** *adj.* not having an associated denotation in a *binding*. See *bound*.

**unbound variable** *n.* a *name* that is syntactically plausible as the name of a *variable* but which is not *bound* in the *variable namespace*. 

**undefined function** *n.* a *name* that is syntactically plausible as the name of a 

*function* but which is not *bound* in the *function namespace*.

**unregistered package** *n.* a *package object* that is not present in the *package* 

*registry*. An *unregistered package* has no *name*; *i.e.*, its *name* is **nil**. See the *function* **delete-package**. 

**unsafe** *adj.* (of *code*) not *safe*. (Note that, unless explicitly specified otherwise, if a particular kind of error checking is guaranteed only in a *safe* context, the same checking might or might not occur in that context if it were *unsafe*; describing a 

context as *unsafe* means that certain kinds of error checking are not reliably enabled but does not guarantee that error checking is definitely disabled.) 

**unsafe call** *n.* a *call* that is not a *safe call*. For more detailed information, see Section 3.5.1.1 (Safe and Unsafe Calls). 

**upgrade** *v.t.* (a declared *type* to an actual *type*) 1. (when creating an *array*) 

to substitute an *actual array element type* for an *expressed array element type* 

when choosing an appropriately *specialized array* representation. See the *function* **upgraded-array-element-type**. 2. (when creating a *complex* ) to substitute an *actual complex part type* for an *expressed complex part type* when choosing an appropriately *specialized complex* representation. See the *function* **upgraded-complex-part-type**. 

**upgraded array element type** *n.* (of a *type*) a *type* that is a *supertype* of the *type* and that is used instead of the *type* whenever the *type* is used as an *array element type* for object creation or type discrimination. See Section 15.1.2.1 (Array Upgrading). 

**upgraded complex part type** *n.* (of a *type*) a *type* that is a *supertype* of the *type* and that is used instead of the *type* whenever the *type* is used as a *complex part type* for object creation or type discrimination. See the *function* **upgraded-complex-part-type**.

**uppercase** *adj.* (of a *character* ) being among *standard characters* corresponding to the capital letters A through Z, or being some other *implementation-defined character* that is defined by the *implementation* to be *uppercase*. See Section 13.1.4.3 (Characters With Case). 

**use** *v.t.* (a *package P*<sub>1</sub>) to *inherit* the *external symbols* of *P*<sub>1</sub>. (If a package *P*<sub>2</sub> uses *P*<sub>1</sub>, the *external symbols* of *P*<sub>1</sub> become *internal symbols* of *P*<sub>2</sub> unless they are explicitly *exported*.) “The package CL-USER uses the package CL.” 

**use list** *n.* (of a *package*) a (possibly empty) *list* associated with each *package* which determines what other *packages* are currently being *used* by that *package*. 

**user** *n.* an active entity, typically a human, that invokes or interacts with a *program* at run time, but that is not necessarily a *programmer* . 

**V** 

**valid array dimension** *n.* a *fixnum* suitable for use as an *array dimension*. 

Such a *fixnum* must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than the *value* of **array-dimension-limit**. When multiple *array dimensions* are to be used together to specify a multi-dimensional *array*, there is also an implied constraint that the product of all of the *dimensions* be less than the *value* of **array-total-size-limit**. 

**valid array index** *n.* (of an *array*) a *fixnum* suitable for use as one of possibly several indices needed to name an *element* of the *array* according to a multi-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Such a *fixnum* must be greater than or equal to zero, and must be less than the corresponding *dimension*<sub>1</sub> of the *array*. (Unless otherwise explicitly specified, the phrase “a *list* of *valid array indices*” further implies that the *length* of the *list* must be the same as the *rank* of the *array*.) “For a 2 by 3 array, valid array indices for the first dimension are 0 and 1, and valid array indices for the second dimension are 0, 1 and 2.” 

**valid array row-major index** *n.* (of an *array*, which might have any number of *dimensions*<sub>2</sub>) a single *fixnum* suitable for use in naming any *element* of the *array*, by viewing the array’s storage as a linear series of *elements* in row-major order. Such a *fixnum* must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than the *array total size* of the *array*. 

**valid fill pointer** *n.* (of an *array*) a *fixnum* suitable for use as a *fill pointer* for the *array*. Such a *fixnum* must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to the *array total size* of the *array*. 

**valid logical pathname host** *n.* a *string* that has been defined as the name of a *logical host*. See the *function* **load-logical-pathname-translations**.

Such an *integer* must be greater than or equal to zero, and must be less than the *length* of the *sequence*. (If the *sequence* is an *array*, the *valid sequence index* is further constrained to be a *fixnum*.) 

**value** *n.* 1. a. one of possibly several *objects* that are the result of an *evaluation*. b. (in a situation where exactly one value is expected from the *evaluation* of a *form*) the *primary value* returned by the *form*. c. (of *forms* in an *implicit progn*) one of possibly 

several *objects* that result from the *evaluation* of the last *form*, or **nil** if there are no *forms*. 2. an *object* associated with a *name* in a *binding*. 3. (of a *symbol*) the *value* of the *dynamic variable* named by that symbol. 4. an *object* associated with a *key* in an *association list*, a *property list*, or a *hash table*.
