**21.1 Stream Concepts** 

**21.1.1 Introduction to Streams** 

A *stream* is an *object* that can be used with an input or output function to identify an appropriate source or sink of *characters* or *bytes* for that operation. A *character stream* is a source or sink of *characters*. A *binary stream* is a source or sink of *bytes*. 

Some operations may be performed on any kind of *stream*; Figure 21–1 provides a list of *standardized* operations that are potentially useful with any kind of *stream*.

**Figure 21–1. Some General-Purpose Stream Operations** 

Other operations are only meaningful on certain *stream types*. For example, **read-char** is only defined for *character streams* and **read-byte** is only defined for *binary streams*. 

**21.1.1.1 Abstract Classifications of Streams** 

**21.1.1.1.1 Input, Output, and Bidirectional Streams** 

A *stream*, whether a *character stream* or a *binary stream*, can be an *input stream* (source of data), an *output stream* (sink for data), both, or (*e.g.*, when “:direction :probe” is given to **open**) neither.

**Figure 21–3. Operators relating to Output Streams.** 

A *stream* that is both an *input stream* and an *output stream* is called a *bidirectional stream*. See the *functions* **input-stream-p** and **output-stream-p**. 

Any of the *operators* listed in Figure 21–2 or Figure 21–3 can be used with *bidirectional streams*. In addition, Figure 21–4 shows a list of *operators* that relate specificaly to *bidirectional streams*.

**Figure 21–4. Operators relating to Bidirectional Streams.** 

**21.1.1.1.2 Open and Closed Streams** 

*Streams* are either *open* or *closed*. 

Except as explicitly specified otherwise, operations that create and return *streams* return *open streams*. 

The action of *closing* a *stream* marks the end of its use as a source or sink of data, permitting the *implementation* to reclaim its internal data structures, and to free any external resources which might have been locked by the *stream* when it was opened. 

Except as explicitly specified otherwise, the consequences are undefined when a *closed stream* is used where a *stream* is called for. 

Coercion of *streams* to *pathnames* is permissible for *closed streams*; in some situations, such as for a *truename* computation, the result might be different for an *open stream* and for that same *stream* once it has been *closed*. 

**21.1.1.1.3 Interactive Streams** 

An *interactive stream* is one on which it makes sense to perform interactive querying. 

The precise meaning of an *interactive stream* is *implementation-defined*, and may depend on the underlying operating system. Some examples of the things that an *implementation* might choose to use as identifying characteristics of an *interactive stream* include:

Version 15.17R, X3J13/94-101R. 

Fri 12-Aug-1994 6:35pm EDT 

*•* The *stream* is connected to a person (or equivalent) in such a way that the program can prompt for information and expect to receive different input depending on the prompt. 

*•* The program is expected to prompt for input and support “normal input editing”. 

*•* **read-char** might wait for the user to type something before returning instead of immediately returning a character or end-of-file. 

The general intent of having some *streams* be classified as *interactive streams* is to allow them to be distinguished from streams containing batch (or background or command-file) input. Output to batch streams is typically discarded or saved for later viewing, so interactive queries to such streams might not have the expected effect. 

*Terminal I/O* might or might not be an *interactive stream*. 

**21.1.1.2 Abstract Classifications of Streams** 

**21.1.1.2.1 File Streams** 

Some *streams*, called *file streams*, provide access to *files*. An *object* of *class* **file-stream** is used to represent a *file stream*. 

The basic operation for opening a *file* is **open**, which typically returns a *file stream* (see its dictionary entry for details). The basic operation for closing a *stream* is **close**. The macro **with-open-file** is useful to express the common idiom of opening a *file* for the duration of a given body of *code*, and assuring that the resulting *stream* is closed upon exit from that body. 

**21.1.1.3 Other Subclasses of Stream** 

The *class* **stream** has a number of *subclasses* defined by this specification. Figure 21–5 shows some information about these subclasses.

*Variables* whose *values* must be *streams* are sometimes called *stream variables*. 

Certain *stream variables* are defined by this specification to be the proper source of input or output in various *situations* where no specific *stream* has been specified instead. A complete list of such *standardized stream variables* appears in Figure 21–6. The consequences are undefined if at any time the *value* of any of these *variables* is not an *open stream*.

**stream** *System Class* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**stream**, **t** 

**Description:** 

A *stream* is an *object* that can be used with an input or output function to identify an appropriate source or sink of *characters* or *bytes* for that operation. 

For more complete information, see Section 21.1 (Stream Concepts).

**broadcast-stream** *System Class* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**broadcast-stream**, **stream**, **t** 

**Description:** 

A *broadcast stream* is an *output stream* which has associated with it a set of zero or more *output streams* such that any output sent to the *broadcast stream* gets passed on as output to each of the associated *output streams*. (If a *broadcast stream* has no *component streams*, then all output to the *broadcast stream* is discarded.) 

The set of operations that may be performed on a *broadcast stream* is the intersection of those for its associated *output streams*. 

Some output operations (*e.g.*, **fresh-line**) return *values* based on the state of the *stream* at the time of the operation. Since these *values* might differ for each of the *component streams*, it is necessary to describe their return value specifically: 

*•* **stream-element-type** returns the value from the last component stream, or **t** if there are no component streams. 

*•* **fresh-line** returns the value from the last component stream, or **nil** if there are no component streams. 

Streams **21–7**

Version 15.17R, X3J13/94-101R. 

Fri 12-Aug-1994 6:35pm EDT 

*•* The functions **file-length**, **file-position**, **file-string-length**, and **stream-external-format** return the value from the last component stream; if there are no component 

streams, **file-length** and **file-position** return 0, **file-string-length** returns 1, and **stream-external-format** returns :default. 

*•* The functions **streamp** and **output-stream-p** always return *true* for *broadcast streams*. 

*•* The functions **open-stream-p** tests whether the *broadcast stream* is *open*<sub>2</sub>, not whether its component streams are *open*. 

*•* The functions **input-stream-p** and *interactive-stream-p* return an *implementation-defined*, *generalized boolean* value. 

*•* For the input operations **clear-input listen**, **peek-char**, **read-byte**, **read-char-no-hang**, **read-char**, **read-line**, and **unread-char**, the consequences are undefined if the indicated operation is performed. However, an *implementation* is permitted to define such a behavior as an *implementation-dependent* extension. 

For any output operations not having their return values explicitly specified above or elsewhere in this document, it is defined that the *values* returned by such an operation are the *values* resulting from performing the operation on the last of its *component streams*; the *values* resulting from performing the operation on all preceding *streams* are discarded. If there are no *component streams*, the value is *implementation-dependent*.

**concatenated-stream** *System Class* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**concatenated-stream**, **stream**, **t** 

**Description:** 

A *concatenated stream* is an *input stream* which is a *composite stream* of zero or more other *input streams*, such that the sequence of data which can be read from the *concatenated stream* is the same as the concatenation of the sequences of data which could be read from each of the constituent *streams*. 

Input from a *concatenated stream* is taken from the first of the associated *input streams* until it reaches *end of file*<sub>1</sub>; then that *stream* is discarded, and subsequent input is taken from the next *input stream*, and so on. An *end of file* on the associated *input streams* is always managed invisibly by the *concatenated stream*—the only time a client of a *concatenated stream* sees an *end of file* is

**Description:** 

An *echo stream* is a *bidirectional stream* that gets its input from an associated *input stream* and sends its output to an associated *output stream*. 

All input taken from the *input stream* is echoed to the *output stream*. Whether the input is echoed immediately after it is encountered, or after it has been read from the *input stream* is *implementation-dependent*.

**peek-char** 

**peek-char** *Function* **Syntax:** 

**peek-char** &optional *peek-type input-stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*peek-type*—a *character* or **t** or **nil**. 

*→ char* 

*input-stream*—*input stream designator* . The default is *standard input*. 

*eof-error-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *true*. 

*eof-value*—an *object*. The default is **nil**. 

*recursive-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *false*. 

*char*—a *character* or the *eof-value*. 

**Description:** 

**peek-char** obtains the next character in *input-stream* without actually reading it, thus leaving the character to be read at a later time. It can also be used to skip over and discard intervening characters in the *input-stream* until a particular character is found. 

If *peek-type* is not supplied or **nil**, **peek-char** returns the next character to be read from *input-stream*, without actually removing it from *input-stream*. The next time input is done from *input-stream*, the character will still be there. If *peek-type* is **t**, then **peek-char** skips over *whitespace*<sub>2</sub> *characters*, but not comments, and then performs the peeking operation on the next character. The last character examined, the one that starts an *object*, is not removed from *input-stream*. If *peek-type* is a *character* , then **peek-char** skips over input characters until a character that is **char=** to that *character* is found; that character is left in *input-stream*. 

If an *end of file*<sub>2</sub> occurs and *eof-error-p* is *false*, *eof-value* is returned. 

If *recursive-p* is *true*, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to **read** or a similar *function* used by the *Lisp reader* . 

When *input-stream* is an *echo stream*, characters that are only peeked at are not echoed. In the case that *peek-type* is not **nil**, the characters that are passed by **peek-char** are treated as if by **read-char**, and so are echoed unless they have been marked otherwise by **unread-char**. 

**Examples:** 

(with-input-from-string (input-stream " 1 2 3 4 5") 

(format t "~S ~S ~S" 

(peek-char t input-stream)

When *input-stream* is an *echo stream*, the character is echoed on *input-stream* the first time the character is seen.

**terpri, fresh-line** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**terpri** &optional *output-stream →* **nil** 

**fresh-line** &optional *output-stream → generalized-boolean* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*output-stream* – an *output stream designator* . The default is *standard output*. 

*generalized-boolean*—a *generalized boolean*. 

**Description:** 

**terpri** outputs a *newline* to *output-stream*. 

**fresh-line** is similar to **terpri** but outputs a *newline* only if the *output-stream* is not already at the start of a line. If for some reason this cannot be determined, then a *newline* is output anyway. **fresh-line** returns *true* if it outputs a *newline*; otherwise it returns *false*.

**unread-char** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**unread-char** *character* &optional *input-stream →* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*character*—a *character* ; must be the last *character* that was read from *input-stream*. *input-stream*—an *input stream designator* . The default is *standard input*. 

**Description:** 

**unread-char** places *character* back onto the front of *input-stream* so that it will again be the next character in *input-stream*. 

When *input-stream* is an *echo stream*, no attempt is made to undo any echoing of the character that might already have been done on *input-stream*. However, characters placed on *input-stream* by **unread-char** are marked in such a way as to inhibit later re-echo by **read-char**. 

It is an error to invoke **unread-char** twice consecutively on the same *stream* without an intervening call to **read-char** (or some other input operation which implicitly reads characters) on that *stream*. 

Invoking **peek-char** or **read-char** commits all previous characters. The consequences of invoking **unread-char** on any character preceding that which is returned by **peek-char** (including those passed over by **peek-char** that has a *non-nil peek-type*) are unspecified. In particular, the consequences of invoking **unread-char** after **peek-char** are unspecified.

*line*—a *string* or the *eof-value*. 

*missing-newline-p*—a *generalized boolean*. 

**Description:** 

Reads from *input-stream* a line of text that is terminated by a *newline* or *end of file*. 

If *recursive-p* is *true*, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to **read** or a similar *function* used by the *Lisp reader* . 

The *primary value*, *line*, is the line that is read, represented as a *string* (without the trailing *newline*, if any). If *eof-error-p* is *false* and the *end of file* for *input-stream* is reached before any *characters* are read, *eof-value* is returned as the *line*. 

The *secondary value*, *missing-newline-p*, is a *generalized boolean* that is *false* if the *line* was terminated by a *newline*, or *true* if the *line* was terminated by the *end of file* for *input-stream* (or if the *line* is the *eof-value*).

When *position-spec* is supplied, the *file position* in *stream* is set to that *file position* (if possible). **file-position** returns *true* if the repositioning is performed successfully, or *false* if it is not. 

An *integer* returned by **file-position** of one argument should be acceptable as *position-spec* for use with the same file. 

For a character file, performing a single **read-char** or **write-char** operation may cause the file position to be increased by more than 1 because of character-set translations (such as translating between the Common Lisp #\Newline character and an external ASCII carriage-return/line-feed

**Examples:**

(let ((noticed ’()) file-written) 

(flet ((notice (x) (push x noticed) x)) 

(with-open-file (s "test.bin"

**Side Effects:** 

When the *position-spec* argument is supplied, the *file position* in the *stream* might be moved.

The value returned by **file-position** increases monotonically as input or output operations are performed.

**Exceptional Situations:** 

If *position-spec* is supplied, but is too large or otherwise inappropriate, an error is signaled. 

**See Also:** 

**file-length**, **file-string-length**, **open** 

**Notes:** 

Implementations that have character files represented as a sequence of records of bounded size might choose to encode the file position as, for example, *hhrecord-number ii*\**hhmax-record sizeii*+*hhcharacter-within-recordii*. This is a valid encoding because it increases monotonically as each character is read or written, though not necessarily by 1 at each step. An *integer* might then be considered “inappropriate” as *position-spec* to **file-position** if, when decoded into record number and character number, it turned out that the supplied record was too short for the specified character number. 

**file-string-length** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**file-string-length** *stream object → length* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*stream*—an *output character file stream*. 

*object*—a *string* or a *character* . 

*length*—a non-negative *integer* , or **nil**. 

**Description:** 

**file-string-length** returns the difference between what (file-position *stream*) would be after writing *object* and its current value, or **nil** if this cannot be determined. 

The returned value corresponds to the current state of *stream* at the time of the call and might not be the same if it is called again when the state of the *stream* has changed.

**Syntax:** 

**open** *filespec* &key *direction element-type* 

*if-exists if-does-not-exist external-format* 

*→ stream* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*filespec*—a *pathname designator* . 

*direction*—one of :input, :output, :io, or :probe. The default is :input. 

*element-type*—a *type specifier* for *recognizable subtype* of **character**; or a *type specifier* for a *finite recognizable subtype* of *integer* ; or one of the *symbols* **signed-byte**, **unsigned-byte**, or :default. The default is **character**. 

*if-exists*—one of :error, :new-version, :rename, :rename-and-delete, :overwrite, :append, :supersede, or **nil**. The default is :new-version if the version component of *filespec* is :newest, or :error otherwise. 

*if-does-not-exist*—one of :error, :create, or **nil**. The default is :error if *direction* is :input or *if-exists* is :overwrite or :append; :create if *direction* is :output or :io, and *if-exists* is neither :overwrite nor :append; or **nil** when *direction* is :probe. 

*external-format*—an *external file format designator* . The default is :default. 

*stream*—a *file stream* or **nil**. 

**Description:** 

**open** creates, opens, and returns a *file stream* that is connected to the file specified by *filespec*. *Filespec* is the name of the file to be opened. If the *filespec designator* is a *stream*, that *stream* is not closed first or otherwise affected. 

The keyword arguments to **open** specify the characteristics of the *file stream* that is returned, and how to handle errors. 

If *direction* is :input or :probe, or if *if-exists* is not :new-version and the version component of the *filespec* is :newest, then the file opened is that file already existing in the file system that has a version greater than that of any other file in the file system whose other pathname components are the same as those of *filespec*. 

An implementation is required to recognize all of the **open** keyword options and to do something reasonable in the context of the host operating system. For example, if a file system does not support distinct file versions and does not distinguish the notions of deletion and expunging, :new-version might be treated the same as :rename or :supersede, and :rename-and-delete might be treated the same as :supersede.

**open** 

:direction 

These are the possible values for *direction*, and how they affect the nature of the *stream* that is created: 

:input 

Causes the creation of an *input file stream*. 

:output 

Causes the creation of an *output file stream*. 

:io 

Causes the creation of a *bidirectional file stream*. 

:probe 

Causes the creation of a “no-directional” *file stream*; in effect, the *file stream* is 

created and then closed prior to being returned by **open**. 

:element-type 

The *element-type* specifies the unit of transaction for the *file stream*. If it is :default, the unit is determined by *file system*, possibly based on the *file*. 

:if-exists 

*if-exists* specifies the action to be taken if *direction* is :output or :io and a file of the name *filespec* already exists. If *direction* is :input, not supplied, or :probe, *if-exists* is ignored. These are the results of **open** as modified by *if-exists*: 

:error 

An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 

:new-version 

A new file is created with a larger version number. 

:rename 

The existing file is renamed to some other name and then a new file is created. 

:rename-and-delete 

The existing file is renamed to some other name, then it is deleted but not 

expunged, and then a new file is created.

**open** 

:overwrite 

Output operations on the *stream* destructively modify the existing file. If *direction* 

is :io the file is opened in a bidirectional mode that allows both reading and 

writing. The file pointer is initially positioned at the beginning of the file; however, 

the file is not truncated back to length zero when it is opened. 

:append 

Output operations on the *stream* destructively modify the existing file. The file 

pointer is initially positioned at the end of the file. 

If *direction* is :io, the file is opened in a bidirectional mode that allows both 

reading and writing. 

:supersede 

The existing file is superseded; that is, a new file with the same name as the old 

one is created. If possible, the implementation should not destroy the old file until 

the new *stream* is closed. 

**nil** 

No file or *stream* is created; instead, **nil** is returned to indicate failure. 

:if-does-not-exist 

*if-does-not-exist* specifies the action to be taken if a file of name *filespec* does not already exist. These are the results of **open** as modified by *if-does-not-exist*: 

:error 

An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 

:create 

An empty file is created. Processing continues as if the file had already existed but 

no processing as directed by *if-exists* is performed. 

**nil** 

No file or *stream* is created; instead, **nil** is returned to indicate failure. 

:external-format 

This option selects an *external file format* for the *file*: The only *standardized* value for this option is :default, although *implementations* are permitted to define additional *external file formats* and *implementation-dependent* values returned by **stream-external-format** can also be used by *conforming programs*.

**open** 

The *external-format* is meaningful for any kind of *file stream* whose *element type* is a *subtype* of *character* . This option is ignored for *streams* for which it is not meaningful; however, *implementations* may define other *element types* for which it is meaningful. The consequences are unspecified if a *character* is written that cannot be represented by the given *external file format*. 

When a file is opened, a *file stream* is constructed to serve as the file system’s ambassador to the Lisp environment; operations on the *file stream* are reflected by operations on the file in the file system. 

A file can be deleted, renamed, or destructively modified by **open**. 

For information about opening relative pathnames, see Section 19.2.3 (Merging Pathnames). **Examples:**

(open s :direction :output :if-exists nil) *→* NIL 

**Affected By:** 

The nature and state of the host computer’s *file system*. 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

If *if-exists* is :error, (subject to the constraints on the meaning of *if-exists* listed above), an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 

If *if-does-not-exist* is :error (subject to the constraints on the meaning of *if-does-not-exist* listed above), an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 

If it is impossible for an implementation to handle some option in a manner close to what is specified here, an error of *type* **error** might be signaled. 

An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if (wild-pathname-p *filespec*) returns true. 

An error of *type* **error** is signaled if the *external-format* is not understood by the *implementation*. 

The various *file systems* in existence today have widely differing capabilities, and some aspects of the *file system* are beyond the scope of this specification to define. A given *implementation* might not be able to support all of these options in exactly the manner stated. An *implementation* is required to recognize all of these option keywords and to try to do something “reasonable” in the context of the host *file system*. Where necessary to accomodate the *file system*, an *implementation*

deviate slightly from the semantics specified here without being disqualified for consideration as a *conforming implementation*. If it is utterly impossible for an *implementation* to handle some option in a manner similar to what is specified here, it may simply signal an error. 

With regard to the :element-type option, if a *type* is requested that is not supported by the *file system*, a substitution of types such as that which goes on in *upgrading* is permissible. As a minimum requirement, it should be the case that opening an *output stream* to a *file* in a given *element type* and later opening an *input stream* to the same *file* in the same *element type* should work compatibly.

When *element-type* is a *subtype* of **character**, **read-char** and/or **write-char** can be used on the resulting *file stream*. 

When *element-type* is a *subtype* of *integer* , **read-byte** and/or **write-byte** can be used on the resulting *file stream*.

**Arguments and Values:** 

*stream* – a variable. 

*filespec*—a *pathname designator* . 

*options* – *forms*; evaluated. 

*declaration*—a **declare** *expression*; not evaluated. 

*forms*—an *implicit progn*. 

*results*—the *values* returned by the *forms*. 

**Description:** 

**with-open-file** uses **open** to create a *file stream* to *file* named by *filespec*. *Filespec* is the name of the file to be opened. *Options* are used as keyword arguments to **open**. 

The *stream object* to which the *stream variable* is *bound* has *dynamic extent*; its *extent* ends when the *form* is exited. 

**with-open-file** evaluates the *forms* as an *implicit progn* with *stream* bound to the value returned by **open**. 

When control leaves the body, either normally or abnormally (such as by use of **throw**), the file is automatically closed. If a new output file is being written, and control leaves abnormally, the file is aborted and the file system is left, so far as possible, as if the file had never been opened.

**with-open-file** 

It is possible by the use of :if-exists nil or :if-does-not-exist nil for *stream* to be bound to **nil**. Users of :if-does-not-exist nil should check for a valid *stream*. 

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to *assign* the *stream variable*. The compiler may choose to issue a warning if such an attempt is detected. 

**Examples:** 

(setq p (merge-pathnames "test")) 

*→* #<PATHNAME :HOST NIL :DEVICE *device-name* :DIRECTORY *directory-name* 

:NAME "test" :TYPE NIL :VERSION :NEWEST>

(format t "~&\*\*\* ~A~%" l))) 

*.* \*\*\* Here are a couple 

*.* \*\*\* of test data lines

;; Normally one would not do this intentionally because it is 

;; not perspicuous, but beware when using :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL 

;; that this doesn’t happen to you accidentally... 

(with-open-file (foo "no-such-file" :if-does-not-exist nil) 

(read foo)) 

*.* hello? 

*→* HELLO? ;This value was read from the terminal, not a file!

(with-open-file (foo "no-such-file" :direction :output :if-does-not-exist nil) (format foo "Hello")) 

*→* "Hello" ;FORMAT got an argument of NIL! 

**Side Effects:** 

Creates a *stream* to the *file* named by *filename* (upon entry), and closes the *stream* (upon exit). In some *implementations*, the *file* might be locked in some way while it is open. If the *stream* is an *output stream*, a *file* might be created.

The host computer’s file system.

*abort*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *false*. 

*result*—**t** if the *stream* was *open* at the time it was received as an *argument*, or *implementation dependent* otherwise. 

**Description:** 

**close** closes *stream*. Closing a *stream* means that it may no longer be used in input or output operations. The act of *closing* a *file stream* ends the association between the *stream* and its associated *file*; the transaction with the *file system* is terminated, and input/output may no longer be performed on the *stream*. 

If *abort* is *true*, an attempt is made to clean up any side effects of having created *stream*. If *stream* performs output to a file that was created when the *stream* was created, the file is deleted and any previously existing file is not superseded. 

It is permissible to close an already closed *stream*, but in that case the *result* is *implementation dependent*. 

After *stream* is closed, it is still possible to perform the following query operations upon it: **streamp**, **pathname**, **truename**, **merge-pathnames**, **pathname-host**, **pathname-device**, **pathname-directory**,**pathname-name**, **pathname-type**, **pathname-version**, **namestring**, **file-namestring**, **directory-namestring**, **host-namestring**, **enough-namestring**, **open**, **probe-file**, and **directory**. 

The effect of **close** on a *constructed stream* is to close the argument *stream* only. There is no effect on the *constituents* of *composite streams*. 

For a *stream* created with **make-string-output-stream**, the result of **get-output-stream-string** is unspecified after **close**.

*Var* is bound to the value of *stream*, and then *forms* are executed as an *implicit progn*. *stream* is automatically closed on exit from **with-open-stream**, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal. The *stream* has *dynamic extent*; its *extent* ends when the *form* is exited. 

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to *assign* the the *variable var* with the *forms*.

**clear-output** &optional *output-stream →* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*output-stream*—an *output stream designator* . The default is *standard output*. 

**Description:** 

**finish-output**, **force-output**, and **clear-output** exercise control over the internal handling of buffered stream output. 

**finish-output** attempts to ensure that any buffered output sent to *output-stream* has reached its destination, and then returns. 

**force-output** initiates the emptying of any internal buffers but does not wait for completion or acknowledgment to return. 

**clear-output** attempts to abort any outstanding output operation in progress in order to allow as little output as possible to continue to the destination. 

If any of these operations does not make sense for *output-stream*, then it does nothing. The precise actions of these *functions* are *implementation-dependent*.

**yes-or-no-p** &optional *control* &rest *arguments → generalized-boolean* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*control*—a *format control*. 

*arguments*—*format arguments* for *control*. 

*generalized-boolean*—a *generalized boolean*. 

**Description:** 

These functions ask a question and parse a response from the user. They return *true* if the answer is affirmative, or *false* if the answer is negative. 

**y-or-n-p** is for asking the user a question whose answer is either “yes” or “no.” It is intended that the reply require the user to answer a yes-or-no question with a single character. **yes-or-no-p** is also for asking the user a question whose answer is either “Yes” or “No.” It is intended that the reply require the user to take more action than just a single keystroke, such as typing the full word yes or no followed by a newline. 

**21–44** Programming Language—Common Lisp

Version 15.17R, X3J13/94-101R. 

Fri 12-Aug-1994 6:35pm EDT 

**y-or-n-p** types out a message (if supplied), reads an answer in some *implementation-dependent* manner (intended to be short and simple, such as reading a single character such as Y or N). **yes-or-no-p** types out a message (if supplied), attracts the user’s attention (for example, by ringing the terminal’s bell), and reads an answer in some *implementation-dependent* manner (intended to be multiple characters, such as YES or NO). 

If *format-control* is supplied and not **nil**, then a **fresh-line** operation is performed; then a message is printed as if *format-control* and *arguments* were given to **format**. In any case, **yes-or-no-p** and **y-or-n-p** will provide a prompt such as “(Y or N)” or “(Yes or No)” if appropriate. 

All input and output are performed using *query I/O*. 

**Examples:** 

(y-or-n-p "(t or nil) given by") 

*.* (t or nil) given by (Y or N) Y 

*→ true* 

(yes-or-no-p "a ~S message" ’frightening) 

*.* a FRIGHTENING message (Yes or No) no 

*→ false* 

(y-or-n-p "Produce listing file?") 

*.* Produce listing file? 

*.* Please respond with Y or N. n 

*→ false* 

**Side Effects:** 

Output to and input from *query I/O* will occur. 

**Affected By:** 

**\*query-io\***. 

**See Also:** 

**format** 

**Notes:** 

**yes-or-no-p** and **yes-or-no-p** do not add question marks to the end of the prompt string, so any desired question mark or other punctuation should be explicitly included in the text query.

*String* is evaluated first, and *var* is bound to a character *input string stream* that supplies *characters* from the subsequence of the resulting *string bounded* by *start* and *end*. The body is executed as an *implicit progn*. 

The *input string stream* is automatically closed on exit from **with-input-from-string**, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal. The *input string stream* to which the *variable var* is *bound* has *dynamic extent*; its *extent* ends when the *form* is exited. 

The *index* is a pointer within the *string* to be advanced. If **with-input-from-string** is exited normally, then *index* will have as its *value* the index into the *string* indicating the first character not read which is (length *string*) if all characters were used. The place specified by *index* is not updated as reading progresses, but only at the end of the operation. 

*start* and *index* may both specify the same variable, which is a pointer within the *string* to be advanced, perhaps repeatedly by some containing loop. 

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to *assign* the *variable var*. 

**Examples:** 

(with-input-from-string (s "XXX1 2 3 4xxx"

**Description:** 

**with-output-to-string** creates a character *output stream*, performs a series of operations that may send results to this *stream*, and then closes the *stream*. 

The *element-type* names the *type* of the elements of the *stream*; a *stream* is constructed of the most specialized *type* that can accommodate elements of the given *type*. 

The body is executed as an *implicit progn* with *var* bound to an *output string stream*. All output to that *string stream* is saved in a *string*. 

If *string* is supplied, *element-type* is ignored, and the output is incrementally appended to *string* as if by use of **vector-push-extend**. 

The *output stream* is automatically closed on exit from **with-output-from-string**, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal. The *output string stream* to which the *variable var* is *bound* has *dynamic extent*; its *extent* ends when the *form* is exited. 

If no *string* is provided, then **with-output-from-string** produces a *stream* that accepts characters and returns a *string* of the indicated *element-type*. If *string* is provided, **with-output-to-string** returns the results of evaluating the last *form*. 

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to *assign* the *variable var*. 

**Examples:** 

(setq fstr (make-array ’(0) :element-type ’base-char

The *value* of **\*query-io\***, called *query I/O*, is a *bidirectional stream* to be used when asking questions of the user. The question should be output to this *stream*, and the answer read from it. 

The *value* of **\*standard-input\***, called *standard input*, is a *stream* that is used by many *operators* as a default source of input when no specific *input stream* is explicitly supplied. 

The *value* of **\*standard-output\***, called *standard output*, is a *stream* that is used by many *operators* as a default destination for output when no specific *output stream* is explicitly supplied. 

The *value* of **\*trace-output\***, called *trace output*, is the *stream* on which traced functions (see **trace**) and the **time** *macro* print their output.

*variable*, without unduly restricting *implementation* flexibility. 

It is common for an *implementation* to make the initial *values* of **\*debug-io\*** and **\*query-io\*** be the *same stream*, and to make the initial *values* of **\*error-output\*** and **\*standard-output\*** be the *same stream*. 

The functions **y-or-n-p** and **yes-or-no-p** use *query I/O* for their input and output. 

In the normal *Lisp read-eval-print loop*, input is read from *standard input*. Many input functions, including **read** and **read-char**, take a *stream* argument that defaults to *standard input*. 

In the normal *Lisp read-eval-print loop*, output is sent to *standard output*. Many output functions, including **print** and **write-char**, take a *stream* argument that defaults to *standard output*. 

A program that wants, for example, to divert output to a file should do so by *binding* **\*standard-output\***; that way error messages sent to **\*error-output\*** can still get to the user by going through **\*terminal-io\*** (if **\*error-output\*** is bound to **\*terminal-io\***), which is usually what is desired. 

*∗***terminal-io***∗ Variable* 

**Value Type:** 

a *bidirectional stream*. 

**Initial Value:** 

*implementation-dependent*, but it must be an *open stream* that is not a *generalized synonym stream* to an *I/O customization variables* but that might be a *generalized synonym stream* to the *value* of some *I/O customization variable*. 

**Description:** 

The *value* of **\*terminal-io\***, called *terminal I/O*, is ordinarily a *bidirectional stream* that connects to the user’s console. Typically, writing to this *stream* would cause the output to appear on a display screen, for example, and reading from the *stream* would accept input from a keyboard. It is intended that standard input functions such as **read** and **read-char**, when used with this *stream*, cause echoing of the input into the output side of the *stream*. The means by which this is accomplished are *implementation-dependent*. 

The effect of changing the *value* of **\*terminal-io\***, either by *binding* or *assignment*, is *implementation-defined*.
