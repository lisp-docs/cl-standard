Version: 1.1.

Navigator offers access to PDF features such as:
anchors, outlines (bookmarks), links and actions, embedded files, and raw PDF
code. It works with all formats (some limitations in ConTeXt), and with
pdfTeX, LuaTeX and XeTeX (i.e.  xdvipdfmx), trying to implement a similar
behavior between those drivers.

It requires texapi and YaX, both v.1.03.

Relevant information can be found in navigator-doc.pdf.

navigator.tex      The bulk of the code.
navigator.sty      A wrapper file for LaTeX.
