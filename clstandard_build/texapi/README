Comments and suggestions are welcome.
Date: October 2011.

The package is set of macros to write
format-independent (and -aware) packages.
It is, of course, format-independent,
and requires e-TeX.
Relevant information can be found in texapi-doc.pdf

Files in this distributions:

texapi.tex     => The package (no wrapper files for format, of course).
texapi-doc.tex => The source of the documentation.
texapi-doc.pdf => The typeset documentation.

To process the documentation source, you need the 
PiTeX files (available on CTAN) on top of plain TeX
with LuaTeX at least v.0.6. Non-free fonts are used.
... err, no actually, don't typeset it, the PiTeX version
on CTAN is way too old. It'll be updated someday.

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
